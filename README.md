# Motion-Tracking
This Python script uses OpenCV to track motion by comparing consecutive video frames. It highlights moving objects by detecting changes, applying thresholds, and drawing rectangles around areas of significant motion. It supports both webcam and video file inputs, filtering small movements for more precise tracking.
